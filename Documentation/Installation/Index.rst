Updating to version 2.4.0
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^

The "encoding" :ref:`configuration property <configuration>` has change behavior.
It used to accept all known encoding values plus all the synonyms defined in array
:php:`\TYPO3\CMS\Core\Charset\CharsetConverter::$synonyms`. This array does not
exist in TYPO3 v10 anymore, thus usage of synonyms has been dropped. Check
your configuration and verify that you use encoding names as defined in
https://www.php.net/manual/en/mbstring.supported-encodings.php.
